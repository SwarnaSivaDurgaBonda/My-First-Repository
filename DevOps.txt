DevOps
DevOps=Development + Operations
It's a culture + set of practices + tools that help:
•	Developers (who write the code)
•	Operations (who deploy/manage system)
Work Together, instead of working in slides.
Real time Example
Imagine you’re building a mobile app like Swiggy.
•	The developer writes code to add “trick My Order” feature.
•	Without DevOps: Developer gives code to Ops team-they manually deploy -bugs happen-delays.
•	With DevOps: Code is automatically tested and deployed-customers get updates faster and safely.
DevOps Helps You:
•	Release feature faster (like adding new payment methods in Zomato).
•	Fix bugs quickly (like fixing logon issue in IRCTC).
•	Automate repetitive tasks (like server restarts, database backups).
	
Plan	- Define what to build
Develop	- write the code
Build	- Compile code into deployable formate
Test	- Check for bugs automatically
Release	- Approve the build for deployment
Deploy	- Push app to servers or app store
Operate	- Keep app running, fix any issue
Monitor	- Analyze performance and feedback
